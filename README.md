# Digispark-Attiny85-Downasaur-Chrome-Game
In recent times all makers make little hardware for  Chrome Downasaur game, All are using SG90 servo motor, LDR, and Arduino microcontroller.  Here I am think something different from the traditional flow. 
I also see posts of Chrome Downasaur game using python, they are using Arduino serial communication and use Python code for "space" bar input for chrome game. I like this method. But here I implemented something different. 
I am using digistump ATtiny85 board for control chrome game.
